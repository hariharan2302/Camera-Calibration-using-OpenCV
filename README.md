# Camera-Calibration-using-OpenCV
## Overview 
This project involves conducting camera calibration using a standard checkerboard cube to determine intrinsic parameters such as focal length, principal point, and lens distortion. Calibration algorithms and tools like OpenCV were implemented to optimize camera parameters. Additionally, extrinsic parameters were derived to understand the camera's position and orientation in the 3D world. 
## Key Features 
  - Determined intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, lens distortion).
  - Implemented calibration algorithms using OpenCV. - Derived extrinsic parameters for 3D position and orientation.
## Requirements
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
